# 300 - Weekly

Based on "Weekly Planning" at https://help.noteplan.co/article/160-weekly-planning

Find "Weekly" in the left sidebar under "Daily". Items you are adding to the weekly notes are automatically added to the reference area above every day of that week. On top of that, you can drag & drop things between week and day using the reference area.

If you click on one of the orange numbers in the left-hand column (**CW**) in the calendar, the Weekly will open for that week number.
