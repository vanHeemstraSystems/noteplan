# 100 - Teamspaces

Based on "Introducing: NotePlan Teamspaces (and learn how we manage our team notes at NotePlan using PARA)" at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXRFb5ckVY0

To create a Teamspace, click **+ Create** and then **Teamspace**.

By default, the new Teamspace will have a Daily calender and a Weekly calendar, as well as a few directories (e.g. Projects, Resources, Archive).

The initial name of the new Teamspace will be ```Untitled```. Click on the right-hand side of the new Teamspace and choose **Rename**.

Here we rename the Teamspace to ```Agility Game```.

By right-hand clicking on the Teamspace ```Agility Game``` you have an option to manage (i.e. add, remove) members to/from the teamspace.

For now we do not invite new members, as the one who created the Teamspace will by default be a member, with role ```owner```.

Now add the following folders:

- 20 - Areas: in this folder we can make subfolders for each department (e.g. Engineering, Marketing, Customer Development).

Reading from top to bottom the folders initials spell ```PARA```, a much used structure.
