Based on "Introducing: NotePlan Teamspaces (and learn how we manage our team notes at NotePlan using PARA)" at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXRFb5ckVY0

To create a Teamspace, click **+ Create** and then **Teamspace**.

By default, the new Teamspace will have a Daily calender and a Weekly calendar, as well as a few directories (e.g. Projects, Resources, Archive).

The initial name of the new Teamspace will be ```Untitled```. Click on the right-hand side of the new Teamspace and choose **Rename**.

Here we rename the Teamspace to ```Agility Game```.
